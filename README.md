# 🔐 Secure File Transfer System

A full-stack **secure file transfer web application** built with **Python (Flask)** that lets users:

- Register & log in
- Upload files that are **encrypted before being stored**
- Download their files (automatically **decrypted on download**)
- Securely **share files with other registered users** by username

## ✨ Features

- 🔑 **User Authentication**
  - Register, login, logout using Flask-Login
  - Passwords are stored as **secure hashes**, not plain text

- 🧾 **Encrypted File Storage**
  - Files are encrypted using **Fernet (symmetric encryption)** from `cryptography`
  - Each file gets its **own random key**
  - File key is encrypted with a **master key** before being stored in the database

- 📤 **Secure Upload & Download**
  - On **upload**:
    - File is read as bytes
    - Encrypted using a per-file key
    - Ciphertext is stored on disk (e.g. `instance/uploads/*.enc`)
  - On **download**:
    - Encrypted bytes are read from disk
    - Decrypted server-side
    - Sent back to the user as the original file

- 🤝 **File Sharing**
  - Owner can share a file with another user using their username
  - Only:
    - the **owner**, or  
    - a **user it’s shared with**  
    can download the file

- 🎨 **Modern UI / UX**
  - Dark, **security-themed** design
  - **Poppins** font from Google Fonts
  - Smooth hover effects & transitions
  - Responsive layout for desktop & mobile

- 📊 **Demo-Ready Security**
  - Easy to show encryption using **Wireshark**
  - Good for college mini-projects / final year demos
